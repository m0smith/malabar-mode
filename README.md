# malabar-mode

EMACS integration with the JVM.

## malabar is moving to JDEE

As of October 21, 2016, malabar mode is uniting with https://github.com/jdee-emacs/jdee. No more work will be done on malabar and all
the useful functionality has been or will be moved to JDEE.  I recommend using JDEE instead of malabar (I have).

If there is malabar functionality missing from JDEE, please create an issue at https://github.com/jdee-emacs/jdee/issues with "from malabar" in the title specifying the missing functionality.

I will leave this project up for reference but no issues are being worked and no updates will be made.  My efforts will go to improving JDEE.

## Summary


malabar-mode is a minor-mode with hooks into Maven that makes
it easy to compile files on the fly and execute Maven build
commands.

NOTE:  The java/groovy code has been moved to https://github.com/m0smith/malabar-mode-jar

This is based on a fork of
[buzztaiki's fork](https://github.com/buzztaiki/malabar-mode) of
[espenhw's malabar-mode](https://github.com/espenhw/malabar-mode) which has been merged
back into the master branch. Development of malabar-mode has restarted. This is an attempt to keep it up to date and develop at a modest pace.

You may want to skip to [Installation](#Installation).

## What malabar-mode offers

Since malabar-mode can be used from both java-mode and groovy-mode, we get some things for free:

- Syntax highlighting

- Movement commands (`C-M-f/-b` is a winner; so is `M-f/-b`, especially
  with `c-subword-mode` turned on)

- Electric punctuation 

There's lots more; and since this is Emacs, you can turn off or modify
anything you don't like.

### But there is more:

- Tight integration with [Maven][]. If you're not using Maven, you
  should not consider malabar-mode for now.  Adding [gradle support](https://github.com/m0smith/malabar-mode-jar/issues/18) is pending.

- A [Groovy][] console for rapid prototyping and exploratory programming

- [JUnit][] integration, both for running tests standalone and through Maven

- Debugger integration with EMACS built in GUD

- Import help; import one class or all needed classes in the buffer
  (with prompting if the class name is ambiguous)

- Extend class / implement interface / override method helpers

- Simplistic refactorings

- See the [Cheat Sheet](src/main/lisp/malabar-cheatsheet.org "Malabar Mode Cheat Sheet")

and more.

# Installation

## 2.x

There has been a lot of work to rewrite malabar-mode to make it easier to maintain, install and develop.  It is currently in a beta stage.  Once it has some time to mature, it will be put back into MELPA.  Until then, the installation is manual:

- Install groovy (2.3.7 or later).  Ubunutu has a real old version.  Use GVM to install http://gvmtool.net/

- Install gradle

- Clone https://github.com/alexott/cedet/tree/devel 

```
    git clone https://github.com/alexott/cedet.git
    cd cedet
    make all
```
- Install malabar-mode from melpa

- Install emacs package groovy-mode.  Do not use marmalade version as it is old.

- Add to .emacs: 


```

	(load-file "~/projects/cedet/cedet-devel-load.el")
    (add-hook 'after-init-hook (lambda ()
			     (message "activate-malabar-mode")
			     (activate-malabar-mode)))

    (add-hook 'malabar-java-mode-hook 'flycheck-mode)
    (add-hook 'malabar-groovy-mode-hook 'flycheck-mode)



```

- in emacs (malabar-run-groovy) or C-u M-x run-groovy - you may need to enter the path to groovysh, especially on Windows
- Edit a java/groovy file in a maven2 project
  

**NOTE 1.x is no longer supported and no more development will happen on this branch**

The malabar-mode package is now part of
[MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net/) thanks to this
[issue](https://github.com/dstu/malabar-mode/issues/1).  Make sure you
have the MELPA package archive enabled in your init.el or .emacs and
your package contents are up to date (use `M-x
package-refresh-contents` if you can’t find the malabar-mode package and
you’ve added MELPA to your package archives.


## Prerequisites

### Groovy

Version 2.3.7 or beyond

### Emacs

malabar-mode was originally developed on Emacs 23, but
development now targets Emacs 24.

### CEDET


1. (optional) If you want to mimic the IDEish compile-on-save
   behaviour, add the following as well::

        (add-hook 'malabar-mode-hook
             (lambda () 
               (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'malabar-http-compile-file-silently
                          nil t)))
          
# Usage

Update:  malabar-mode now has a menu.  Yay!

## Java

### What's working

- flycheck integration is working except for the few edge cases where the groovy parser differs from th ejava parser

- cedet integration for java, not working for groovy yet

- unit testing a class or method

### The 3 faces of malabar-mode

The malabar minor mode has three different integrations: an interactive groovy shell (repl), a malabar HTTP server (http), and the external project manager like maven or gradle (pm).  Each of the integrations is managed seperately.  That is, compiling a file using the service will not load that class into the repl.  As such, the functions will be named so it is obvious which integration is used:  `malabar-repl-` , `malabar-http-`, or `malabar-pm-`

Here is a list of available interactive commands by integration, with default keybindings where applicable:

Unit Test



<dl>

<dt><b>malabar-http-run-test</b> <span class="classifier">(C-c C-v t)</span></dt>
<dd>Runs the unit tests in the current class.  With a prefix args, ask for a method name and only run that test</dd>

<dt><b>semantic-ia-describe-class</b> <span class="classifier">(C-c C-v i)</span></dt>
<dd>Show the public variables and methods on a class</dd>

<dt><b>malabar-semantic-heirarchy</b> <span class="classifier">(C-c C-v h)</span></dt>
<dd>Show super classes and interfaces implemented by a class</dd>

<dt><b>malabar-fully-qualified-class-name-kill-ring-save</b> <span class="classifier">(C-c C-v *)</span></dt>
<dd>Copy the fully qualifed classname of the current buffer to the kill ring</dd>

<dt><b>malabar-which</b> <span class="classifier">(C-c C-v w)</span></dt>
<dd>Returns the jar containing the speficied class</dd>

<dt><b>malabar-import-all</b> <span class="classifier">(C-c C-v z)</span></dt>
<dd>Adds import statements for all unqualified classes in the buffer, as
  if by performing <code>malabar-import-one-class</code> on each.</dd>
  
<dt><b>malabar-import-one-class</b> <span class="classifier">(C-c C-v C-z)</span></dt>
<dd><p>Adds an import statement for a single unqualified class (defaults to
  the symbol at point).  If more than one class matches the
  unqualified name you will be asked which class to import.</p>

  <p>The variable <code>malabar-import-excluded-classes-regexp-list</code>
  contains a list of regular expressions; if one of these matches the
  qualified class name, the class will be excluded from import.  The
  default value excludes classes from <code>java.lang</code>, JRE internal
  classes and inner classes.</p></dd>

<dt><b>ede-edit-file-target</b> <span class="classifier">(C-c C-v C-p)</span></dt>
<dd>Visit the project file, that is the closest file named <code>pom.xml</code>
  searching upwards in the directory structure.</dd>

<dt><b>malabar-repl-send-buffer</b> <span class="classifier">(C-c C-v C-k)</span></dt>
<dd>Send the contents of the current buffer to the running groovy instance.  If the buffer is a class rather than a script, prefer <code>malabar-repl-mode-load-class</code></dd>

<dt><b>malabar-stack-trace-buffer</b> <span class="classifier">(C-c C-v C-#)</span></dt>
<dd>Create a new stack trace buffer and optional copy the current region into it.  A stack trace buffer parses the stack trace and allows jumping directly to the error in the source file.  The stack trace buffer will parse whatever stack trace is pasted into it</dd>

<dt><b>malabar-repl-send-classpath-of-buffer</b> <span class="classifier">(C-c C-v s)</span></dt>
<dd>For use with <code>malabar-repl-send-buffer</code> and <code>malabar-repl-mode-load-class</code>, it loads the classpath of the current project into the running groovy buffer.  This allows for code in the current project to be used interactively.</dd>

<dt><b>malabar-repl-send-classpath-element</b> <span class="classifier">(C-c C-v s)</span></dt>
<dd>Add a jar, zip or directory to the running groovy buffer</dd>

<dt><b>malabar-jdb</b> <span class="classifier">(C-c C-v J)</span></dt>
<dd>Start the JDB debugger on the current class.</dd>

<dt>malabar-update-package</dt>
<dd>Updates the package statement of the current buffer to match its place
  in the source directory.</dd>

<dt>malabar-implement-interface <span class="classifier">(C-c C-v C-i)</span></dt>
<dd>Prompts for an interface, adds stub implementations of all that
  interface's methods and adds the interface to the class's implements
  clause.</dd>

<dt>malabar-jump-to-thing <span class="classifier">(C-c C-v C-y)</span></dt>
<dd>Jumps to the definition of the 'thing' at point. More technically,
  uses <code>semantic-analyze-current-context</code> output to identify an origin
  for the code at point, taking type membership into account.  This
  function is much like <code>semantic-ia-fast-jump</code>, only a little
  smarter.</dd>

</dl>

In addition, [standard Semantic code completion][] is available; trigger
this however you wish.  By default, `semantic-ia-complete-symbol` is
bound to `C-c C-v C-.` and `semantic-ia-complete-symbol-menu` is
bound to `C-c C-v .`.

### Still needing attention

The following are either not in 2.0 yet or are only partially working.  If you use any of these regularly, please use the [issue tracker][] to let me know.  Those missing features that have issues added will be given higher priority.  Otherwise, they will be added back in random order.

<dl>

<dt>malabar-http-compile-file <span class="classifier">(C-c C-v C-c)</span></dt>
<dd>Compiles the current file.</dd>

<dt>malabar-clear-typecache</dt>
<dd>Clears the type cache (used for code completion) if it gets
  confused.  If you have to use this often, please file a bug.</dd>
  
<dt>malabar-extend-class <span class="classifier">(C-c C-v C-e)</span></dt>
<dd>Prompts for a class, adds stub implementations of all that class's
  abstract methods and accessible constructors and inserts the
  appropriate extends clause.</dd>
  
<dt>malabar-repl-start</dt>
<dd>Start the Groovy console, or pop to it if it is running.</dd>

<dt>malabar-repl-stop</dt>
<dd>Kill the Groovy console process.</dd>
  
<dt>malabar-run-maven-command</dt>
<dd>Prompts for and executes an (almost) arbitrary Maven command line.
  Honors profile activation, property definitions and lifecycle
  phases/goals.  E.g.: <code>-DskipTests=true -Pdev-mode install</code> will
  run the install lifecycle with the dev-mode profile active, skipping
  tests.</dd>
  
<dt>malabar-install-project <span class="classifier">(C-c C-v C-b)</span></dt>
<dd>Runs <code>mvn install</code> on your project.  With prefix argument (C-u),
  cleans the project first (<code>mvn clean install</code>).</dd>
  
<dt>malabar-override-method <span class="classifier">(C-c C-v C-o)</span></dt>
<dd>Prompts for an eligible method from the superclass of the class at
  point and adds a stub implementation of that method.  If the chosen
  method is one of <code>Object.equals` or `Object.hashCode</code>, override both of them.</dd>
  
<dt>malabar-run-all-tests <span class="classifier">(C-c C-v M-t)</span></dt>
<dd>Runs <code>mvn test</code> on your project.  With prefix argument (C-u),
  cleans the project first (<code>mvn clean test</code>).</dd>
  
<dt>malabar-run-junit-test-no-maven <span class="classifier">(C-c C-v C-t)</span></dt>
<dd>Compiles the current file, performs
  <code>malabar-visit-corresponding-test</code>, compiles that file (if not the
  same as where we started) and runs the now-current buffer as a
  standalone JUnit test.</dd>
  
<dt>malabar-http-run-test <span class="classifier">(C-c C-v t)</span></dt>
<dd>Runs the corresponding test to this buffer using Maven (<code>mvn test -Dtest=classname</code>)</dd>

<dt>malabar-visit-corresponding-test</dt>
<dd><p>Visits the corresponding test class; that is, the file in the
  parallel src/test/java hierarchy that matches the class in the
  current buffer (with <code>malabar-test-class-suffix</code> appended).</p>

  <p>E.g., <code>M-x malabar-visit-corresponding-test</code> in a buffer visiting
  <code>src/main/java/org/grumblesmurf/malabar/MvnServer.java</code> will visit
  the file
  <code>src/test/java/org/grumblesmurf/malabar/MvnServerTest.java</code> with
  the default value of <code>malabar-test-class-suffix</code>.</p>

  <p>If the current buffer looks like a test class, this command does nothing.</p></dd>
  
  
  
<dt>malabar-refactor-extract-constant <span class="classifier">(C-c C-v C-r C-c)</span></dt>
<dd>Extracts the thing at point as a named constant.  The scope of the
  constant will default to
  <code>malabar-refactor-extract-constant-default-scope</code>, but with a
  prefix arg will prompt for the scope.</dd>


</dl>


## Abbrevs

Some default abbrevs are set up, see the variable
`malabar-case-fixed-abbrevs` for the current list.

Note the presence of the `#Test` abbrev; this expands to::

     @Test
     public void |() throws Exception {
         fail("Unfinished test");
     }

With point left at the position marked with `|`.

## Electric expansions

In addition to the electric insertion offered by CC-mode, malabar-mode
offers an expansion that simulates the [Elvis operator][], although the
generated code is not as efficient as a language-provided Elvis
operator would be.  This expansion is controlled by the variable
`malabar-electric-elvis-p`.

# This is cool, I want to help

Github has excellent support for forking!  Just hit the fork button at
the top, code and go.  For everyone's convenience, you should probably
rebase to m0smith/malabar-mode/master every now and then.  :)

If you don't want to go that far, git is, after all, a *distributed*
VCS.  Just commit to your local repository and then use
git-format-patch to extract patches in a useful format.

## But where do I send patches?

To the [issue tracker][] (see the next section).

# I found a bug!

Good for you.  Create a ticket in the [issue tracker][] and stuff will happen.

Hint #1:  Tell me what you did, what you expected to happen and what
actually happened.  Include any error messages (Emacs backtraces,
output in the buffers named starting with `*Malabar`, interesting
stuff from `*Messages*` etc.).

Hint #2:  Bugs with patches tend to be fixed faster (see the previous
section).

# Wouldn't it be cool if malabar-mode could...

Yes, it probably would!  Either describe the feature that you want in
the [issue tracker][], or (even better) fork, code, and ask me to pull.

And of course, if I nix your feature request, you're free to maintain
your own local patch branch if you wish (or, for that matter, a
complete fork).  malabar-mode is Open Source, after all.

# Hacking

This fork of malabar-mode uses [git-flow][] to manage branching
in development. As such, branches are:

<dl>
<dt>develop</dt>
<dd>tracks the latest state of development (that isn't occurring in an isolated branch)</dd>
<dt>master</dt>
<dd>tracks the latest stable snapshot</dd>
</dl>

Feature, release, feature, hotfix, and support branches won't
usually be shared. If they are pushed to github, they shouldn't
be rebased but may disappear after they are merged with
`develop` or `master`.

## Emacs environment

Your Emacs environment can be configured to use a "live" version
of malabar-mode with the following steps:

1. Add the following to your `.emacs`:

    (setq malabar-repl-lib-dir "~/src/malabar-mode/target/lib")
    (setq malabar-repl-extra-classpath '("~/src/malabar-mode/target/classes"))
    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/src/malabar-mode/src/main/lisp/")

2. Run `mvn package -P devel` to extract libraries into
   `target/lib`.
   
With this configuration, you can rebuild malabar-mode's JVM
component with `mvn compile`, which will compile classes into
`target/classes`. To apply these changes, restart malabar-mode
in Emacs with `M-x malabar-repl-restart`.

After editing elisp files, eval them to apply changes
immediately.

## Hints for Cygwin

Try

    (setq malabar-util-path-separator ";")
    (setq malabar-util-path-filter 'cygwin-convert-file-name-to-windows)
    (setq malabar-util-groovy-file-filter 'malabar-util-reverse-slash)
